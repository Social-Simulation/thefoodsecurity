### Global Food Security Association for Young Scientists ###

The world is undergoing profound changes and facing severe challenges. In recent years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, climate disasters, regional conflicts and violence, the global economy is confronted with the greatest challenges in decades. Global food security and nutrition status are deteriorating. Governments, scientists, and international institutes around the world are working together to provide innovative strategies to address emerging and potential challenges. The young generation plays an important role in the governance of current global affairs and will also be the future decision-makers in global affairs. Young scientists are an important force in continuing to promote global dialogue and multilateral cooperation and are the most active and innovative force in tackling global food and inequality issues.

Young Scientists Association of Global Food Security is established to connect young scientists around the world, working in the fields of food security such as climate change, agricultural systems, agricultural technologies, food production, agricultural trade and markets, and food consumption. The association is committed to providing an international platform to encourage young scientists to communicate, exchange ideas, and give voice to the world.
