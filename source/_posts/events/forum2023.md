The 2023 Global Food Security Forum for Young Scientist will be held on 27-29 Oct. 2023, Wuhan, China. The year marks the 2nd anniversary of the Global Food Security Association for Young Scientists, which is jointly founded by Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO). The association is committed to providing an international platform to encourage young scientists to communicate, exchange ideas, and give voice to the world.

The 2023 Global Food Security Forum for Young Scientists aims to revisit the role of agricultural investment and technological innovation in food security and resilience of developing countries in a changing world. In the backdrop of climatic change, more ever-increasing natural hazards, rising food trade protectionism, and lingering geopolitical conflicts, global food security has been threatened; Many developing countries in the Global South face enormous challenges in ensuring sufficient and healthy food for everyone. The critical roles of agricultural investment and technology in increasing food production and enhancing food security have been widely acknowledged. However, in face of the changing world, a series of research questions related to the possible roles of agricultural investment and technological innovation in food security and resilience are raised. What are the constraints of further increases in food production in different regions currently? What kind of agricultural investment and technological innovation could play a significant role in enhancing food production? How could agricultural investment and technological innovation improve the resilience of food production? Answers to these questions will inform the decision-making for enhancing food security and resilience in the changing world.
