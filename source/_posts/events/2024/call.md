<h1 style="text-align: center;">Call For Papers and Short Videos</h1>

The 2024 Global Food Security Forum for Young Scientists will be held on 26-27 October 2024 in Wuhan, China. This year marks the 3rd anniversary of the Global Food Security Association for Young Scientists (GFSAYS), which was jointly founded by Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO). The association, as an international exchange platform, aims to connect young scientists focusing on food security issues from various disciplines.

The 2024 forum will be hosted by HZAU, with the theme of “Enhancing Youth Power for Global Food Security”.

Enhancing youth power is not merely a choice but a necessity in securing global food stability. With an ever-growing population and the looming threat of climate change, the agricultural sector faces unprecedented challenges. Empowering the youth, who represent the future custodians of our planet, is paramount. Their innovative perspectives, creative ideas, and technological adeptness are invaluable assets in revolutionizing agricultural practices for sustainability and resilience. Moreover, investing in youth education, training, and employment opportunities in agriculture not only addresses unemployment but also cultivates a skilled workforce equipped to tackle the complexities of modern food production. Harnessing the potential of young minds is essential in ensuring food security for generations to come, fostering a world where no one goes hungry and where agriculture thrives in harmony with nature.
