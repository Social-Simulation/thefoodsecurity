Scientists, hosted at Huazhong Agricultural University in China and virtually around the world, highlights cutting-edge agricultural research.\n> Author: Sarah McLaughlin\n> Source: [https://www.cimmyt.org/news/inspiring-future-generations-of-scientists/](https://www.cimmyt.org/news/inspiring-future-generations-of-scientists/)\n\nEvidence shows that for every US $1 invested in anticipatory action to safeguard lives and livelihoods, up to US $7 can be saved by avoiding losses in disaster-affected communities, highlighting the power of agricultural research and development that can be continued by the scientists of the future.\n\nThis message was reiterated at the Global Food Security Forum for Young Scientists on December 2-3, designed to bring together scientists, scholars, and innovators from different subjects to discuss their research findings and exchange innovative ideas on all aspects of global food security. The event was co-organized by Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), China, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO).\n\nTopics included the resilience of global food systems and food supply chains, change of dietary patterns and transition of agrifood systems, digital and smart food production, and sustainable agricultural development and maintenance of the environment.\n\nOn behalf of CIMMYT Director General Bram Govaerts, agronomist Iván Ortiz-Monasterio presented at the launch event. “Investing in agriculture and a safe and peaceful future is something that CIMMYT and China can build together,” explained Monasterio. “We can develop networks and platforms of collaboration.

Women and girls are more likely to face food insecurity and malnutrition—in\n        2021, at least 126 million more women than men experienced food insecurity,\n        a gap that continues to grow.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Global food system organizations are critical to advancing gender equality\n        and building women’s empowerment. But how do their own workplace practices\n        measure up? The Global Food 50/50 initiative, a collaboration between Global\n        Health 50/50, IFPRI, and UN Women, assesses how well these organizations\n        perform on gender equality, with the goal of building more effective organizations—and\n        ultimately more equitable and sustainable food systems. Hungry for Gender\n        Equality, the initiative’s second annual report, reviews the gender and\n        equity policies and practices of 51 major organizations, complementing\n        the leadership analysis with a focus on the board members of governing\n        bodies.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The launch event, held October 18 as part of the World Food Prize 2022\n        Borlaug Dialogue virtual side-events, presented major findings from the\n        report and explored potential for future progress. In his opening remarks,\n        Johan Swinnen, CGIAR’s Managing Director for Systems Transformation and\n        IFPRI’s Director General, emphasized the risks facing women: “On the brink\n        of COP27, as the global community comes together to design, implement,\n        and monitor crisis responses, these solutions must provide resources to\n        help women and girls cope with crisis in the short term and challenge the\n        systems that perpetuate inequality.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Sarah Hendriks, Director of the Policy, Programme, and Intergovernmental\n        Division at UN Women, underscored how food systems embed multiple and intersecting\n        forms of discrimination against women and girls. “Now is the time for collective,\n        decisive action and accountability,” she said.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In his keynote address, Ambassador Gabriel Ferrero, Chair of the Committee\n        on World Food Security (CFS), discussed the importance of the Global Food\n        50/50 report to the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s\n        and Girls’ Empowerment in the Context of Food Security and Nutrition, which\n        are currently being negotiated by member states.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        “Global Food 50/50 is not just a report—it is both an accountability and\n        a change mechanism,” said Jemimah Njuki, Chief of Economic Empowerment\n        at UN Women. Sonja Tanaka, Deputy Director of Global Health 50/50, presented\n        in-depth findings from this year’s report. Although public commitment to\n        gender equality remains high, nearly half of organizations in the report’s\n        sample lack transparent plans for diversity and inclusion, and half have\n        more men than women in leadership bodies. Most board seats are occupied\n        by nationals from high-income countries, and 70% of CEOs and board chairs\n        are men. Of the 351 board seats assessed in the report, only 2% are held\n        by women from low-income countries.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In the panel discussion moderated by Hazel Malapit, Senior Research Coordinator\n        at IFPRI, representatives from civil society organizations, development\n        partners, and policymakers highlighted the critical importance of gender\n        equality, both to food systems as a whole and to organizations and their\n        programming.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Within the informal sector, women working in the food supply chain face\n        unique risks related to climate change and markets. Megha Desai, Senior\n        Coordinator for the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in India,\n        noted that the sector’s contribution to food systems is “invisible but\n        vital,” and called for action and research targeting women’s needs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Martha Nyagaya, the Country Director for Kenya at Nutrition International\n        (NI), emphasized the interconnections between food security, nutrition,\n        and gender. “At NI, we try to achieve an equitable, inclusive organization\n        that confronts and addresses gender equity by promoting diversity in our\n        governance structures in leadership and decision-making, but, most importantly,\n        in our programs,” she explained.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        From the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Benjamin Davis, Director\n        of FAO’s Inclusive Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division, discussed\n        recent progress in achieving workplace gender equality, as well as future\n        goals. He commended the GF5050 initiative, saying “the report is a much-needed\n        resource for the global response to gender inequality at the highest institutional\n        level. The fight is not over, and it needs to happen at all levels, from\n        the boardroom to communities to within families.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Maura Barry, the Senior Deputy Assistant to the Administrator for USAID’s\n        Bureau for Resilience and Food Security, highlighted recent White House\n        and USAID initiatives to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\n        “We know that gender equality and women’s empowerment can help eradicate\n        poverty, build vibrant economies, and unlock potential on a transformational\n        scale,” she said, further noting that “if women are not involved in developing\n        and implementing solutions, our work will not be as impactful and sustainable\n        as it could be”.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In closing remarks, Sarah Hawkes, Co-Founder and Co-Director of Global\n        Health 50/50, reflected on the many crises facing the world’s women. She\n        emphasized that “words on paper” mean nothing without implementation, saying\n        “Accountability mechanisms like this report make sure that those great\n        words on paper are actually measured and monitored.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Claire Davis is a Senior Editor with IFPRI's Communications and Public\n        Affairs Division.\n    </p>\n</article>\n","categories":["posts"]},{"title":"Keep calm and trade on: China’s decisive role in agricultural markets under turmoil","url":"/acticle/keep-calm-and-trade-on-chinas-decisive-role-in-agricultural-markets-under-turmoil/","content":"\n<article id=\"events_blog\">\n    <h3>\n        Keep calm and trade on: China’s decisive role in agricultural markets\n        under turmoil\n    </h3>\n    <section class=\"article_description\">\n        <div>\n            <span class=\"p_bold\">\n                Author\n            </span>\n            <span>\n                : IAMO\n            </span>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <span class=\"p_bold\">\n                Source\n            </span>\n            <span>\n                : <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.iamo.de/en/press/press-releases/article/keep-calm-and-trade-on-chinas-decisive-role-in-agricultural-markets-under-turmoil/\">\n                    https://www.iamo.de/en/press/press-releases/article/keep-calm-and-trade-on-chinas-decisive-role-in-agricultural-markets-under-turmoil/\n                </a>\n            </span>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n    <p>\n        China is the world’s largest consumer and importer of agricultural goods.\n            As a result, its trade strategies influence international markets and affect\n            consumers worldwide. However, rising domestic demand for food and limited\n            land and water resources are posing a particular challenge to China’s food\n            security. This is exacerbated by world market price volatility resulting\n            from recent geopolitical tensions, the Covid-19 pandemic, and extreme weather\n            events caused by climate change. The Chinese government has turned to a\n            range of measures to overcome these challenges, including building up immense\n            strategic reserves. In\n            <a href=\"https://www.iamo.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Bilder_und_Dokumente/05-publikationen/IAMO_Policy_Brief/IAMO_Policy_Brief_45_EN.pdf\"\n            target=\"_blank\">\n                IAMO Policy Brief 45\n            </a>\n            Lena Kuhn, Tinoush Jamali Jaghdani, Sören Prehn, Zhanli Sun and Thomas\n            Glauben take a look at these developments and how they affect global markets.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        As the world’s largest consumer and importer of agricultural goods, China\n        has significant influence over world markets. In 2021, China’s imports\n        of agricultural products exceeded its exports by a factor of 2.6 to reach\n        USD 219.8 billion. As China’s middle class grows so too does its domestic\n        demand for high-quality food and, in particular, meat and dairy products.\n        However, both require more land and water resources than the grains and\n        vegetables consumed as part of traditional diets.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        At the same time, production resources are stretching thin. For example,\n        China has 20% of the world’s population but less than 7% of the global\n        freshwater supply, making it one of the most water-scarce countries in\n        the world. For decades, Chinese agricultural policy has therefore focused\n        on increasing agricultural productivity, in particular via higher inputs\n        of fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation, coming at the cost of arable\n        land and water resources.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        It is estimated that the current nutritional transition in China will\n        require an additional three to 12 million hectares of land between 2020\n        and 2050. This will be difficult to meet, as China is already struggling\n        to maintain its current farmland area.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        On 11 June 2022, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs\n        (MARA) launched a rural investment program to stabilise grain production\n        and expand soybean and oilseed production. This included the use of “smart”\n        grain storage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In 2021, China had 142 million metric tons of wheat stocks. This means\n        that while China has 20% of the world’s population, it likely holds more\n        than 50% of the world’s total wheat stocks as a reserve. The same can be\n        observed for corn, which is used mainly in animal feed. China is a key\n        producer of corn, with a self-sufficiency rate of 95.8%. However, it is\n        also the world’s largest net importer of corn. At the end of the last season,\n        China held 210 million metric tons of corn stocks, which accounted for\n        more than two-thirds (68%) of global reserves.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        China’s current high demand for strategic agricultural products is often\n        viewed as a reaction to short-term shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic\n        and, most recently, the war in Ukraine. However, it is more likely a response\n        to long-term macrotrends, particularly those caused by climate change,\n        population growth and higher consumption of animal proteins. Considerable\n        parts of China’s population have reached higher income levels, and demand\n        for food on world markets will therefore continue to increase steadily.\n        It is not clear whether productivity gains can keep pace in the face of\n        climate change and scarce water resources.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Complete self-sufficiency in terms of major food products may be China’s\n        goal, but it can’t be achieved without resource depletion and massive losses\n        in welfare and quality of life. To master the coming challenges, China\n        will have to participate in international markets to share various production,\n        price and logistics risks. International agricultural trade is essential\n        for China to ensure its own food security.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        According to IAMO Director Thomas Glauben, “International agricultural\n        trade remains the key to global food security.

Since late 2021,\n        prices for agricultural commodities such as grains and vegetable oils have\n        reached record highs, surpassing even the levels of the global food price\n        crises of more than a decade ago. Now, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has\n        sent prices soaring even higher. This risks destabilizing food security\n        in import-dependent countries with low per capita incomes, especially in\n        the MENA region and sub-Saharan Africa, that source their wheat from Russia\n        and Ukraine. Disruptions to exports from the Black Sea Region and high\n        prices are further compounding the already critical food situation in these\n        regions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, global demand for wheat is expected to be met in the current\n        marketing year and countries such as India, the USA and Australia will\n        increase exports to fill the supply gap left by Russia and Ukraine. It\n        is difficult to predict what will happen beyond this marketing year, as\n        this will be determined by the development of the current conflict in addition\n        to agricultural fundamentals in key supply and demand regions. However,\n        preliminary forecasts do not predict dramatic changes in the global trade\n        volumes of key agricultural commodities in the coming marketing year. Nevertheless,\n        international agricultural trade flows may have to adapt, which could have\n        negative consequences. Prices are not expected to fall any time soon and\n        consumers, particularly in developing countries, will be expected to carry\n        the burden. European agriculture and consumers are not predicted to experience\n        any major changes in the medium term.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Open and competitive global trade is needed to overcome (potential) trade\n        disruptions and create supply structures that can easily adapt to shocks,\n        no matter the cause. Calls to move towards a centrally planned economy,\n        isolation or self-sufficiency are strongly advised against, as this would\n        only be to the detriment of food security in the Global South.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        “Even if exports from other countries can offset trade disruptions in\n        the Black Sea Region, geopolitical efforts must be made to ensure that\n        Ukraine and Russia remain key parts of the world agricultural trading system.\n        This is the only way to achieve global food security. Their high production\n        and export potential bolsters the ‘safety net of international agricultural\n        trade’ and contributes significantly to combating hunger in the Global\n        South,” says IAMO Director Thomas Glauben.\n    </p>\n</article>\n","categories":["posts"]},{"title":"Bringing voluntary carbon offset markets to smallholder Indian farmers","url":"/acticle/bringing-voluntary-carbon-offset-markets-to-smallholder-indian-farmers/","content":"\n<article id=\"events_blog\">\n    <h3>\n        Bringing voluntary carbon offset markets to smallholder Indian farmers\n    </h3>\n    <div>CIMMYT and ICAR partner to reward Indian farmers for utilizing climate smart agricultural practices.</div>\n    <section class=\"article_description\">\n        <div>\n            <span class=\"p_bold\">\n                Author\n            </span>\n            <span>\n                : John Bakum\n            </span>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <span class=\"p_bold\">\n                Source\n            </span>\n            <span>\n                : <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cimmyt.org/news/bringing-voluntary-carbon-offset-markets-to-smallholder-indian-farmers/\">\n                    https://www.cimmyt.org/news/bringing-voluntary-carbon-offset-markets-to-smallholder-indian-farmers/\n                </a>\n            </span>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n    <p>\n        To mitigate their amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, companies and individuals have access to international voluntary carbon offset markets, which are trading systems that financially compensate credit producer participants for offsetting the amount of carbon emitted. An innovative new initiative from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR) is working to establish carbon markets among smallholder farmers in India, with the goal of reducing GHG emissions, encouraging climate smart farming practices through financial incentives.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In India, agriculture is one of the biggest sources of GHG emissions – between 14 and 21 percent of all GHGs are attributable to agricultural activities, which derive from the use of farm machinery, rice cultivation, fertilizer use, and other activities. Emissions from agriculture are increasing drastically due to synthetic fertilizers and enteric fermentation from livestock.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Within CIMMYT’s farmer-centered approach, participants in voluntary carbon markets will improve their own financial viability in two ways – through adopting sustainable practices and through receipt of payments from carbon markets. The approach will also employ regenerative interventions such as direct dry seeding of rice, minimal tillage, crop diversification, use of biofertilizers, and perennial cropping all while contributing to an overall reduction in GHG emissions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        “Working with ICAR to engage smallholder farmers with high-quality carbon offsets allows the farmers to offset their unavoidable emissions,” said Vijesh Krishna, senior CIMMYT scientist. “This program promotes inclusiveness because this newly created income is distributed among participating farmers, thereby improving their income.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        These regenerative agriculture interventions will increase and retain soil’s carbon content, water permeability and retention, resulting in crops’ ability to withstand drought, flooding, and temperature stresses. Only a small percentage of farmers currently implement these methods in India.\n<br />CIMMYT and ICAR researchers estimate that widespread adoption of these practices, combined with upgraded technologies, has the potential to return the carbon levels in agricultural soils from an average of 0.5 percent back to 1.5 percent. At present, the agricultural soils of India are poor with respect to soil organic carbon.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <div class=\"p_bold\">Carbon markets for smallholders</div>\n        <div>\n            About 2,000 small holder farmers of Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Maharashtra, all in India, are enrolled in the project through individual partnership agreements. Once farmers implement regenerative agricultural methods, they will be eligible to receive payments for carbon credits generated for 10 to 20 years, conditional upon continuing to use climate-smart practices.\n        </div>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        “We believe these efforts can be expanded to other regions of India, and other countries,” said Sieg Snapp, CIMMYT’s Sustainable Agrifood Systems (SAS) program director. “Helping farmers and reducing GHG emissions at the same time is the way forward in dealing the crisis of climate change.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Farms are geo-tagged and monitored using remote sensing for regenerative farming practices, and soil carbon content will be measured at the beginning and end of the crop cycle. Those that produce rice and wheat with a lower carbon footprint will be identified, so their produce gets purchase and price preferences from those who want to promote lower carbon agriculture.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Digital agronomy tools and satellite imagery analysis to measure and verify soil carbon offsets and on-farm GHG emission levels are essential for scaling small farmer-centered carbon projects. The veracity, transparency, and traceability of each carbon offset have direct implications for its credibility and actual market value. CIMMYT will contribute towards a Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) platform to expand climate action country-wide.\n    </p>\n<p>So far, CIMMYT and ICAR researchers estimate that the enrolled smallholder famers have sequestered between four and five tons of carbon dioxide. After independent third-party auditors verify the data, farmers will be paid based on the amount of GHG reduction, with the first carbon offset payments expected to be issued in 2023.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <div class=\"p_bold\">People</div>\n        <div>Sieglinde Snapp</div>\n        <div>Vijesh V.

Yet many food system challenges remain, driven by effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising global food prices, and other problems. ASEAN food value chains are growing more internationalized in an environment of global economic stresses and uncertainty, raising questions about how best to achieve structural change.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The recently-concluded Agricultural Transformation and Market Integration in the ASEAN region (ATMI-ASEAN) project, launched in 2016, focused on strengthening member states’ capacity to develop effective food security and agricultural policies. On June 1-2, project participants and experts met in a high-level policy forum in Hanoi to discuss the project’s five years of rigorous research studies, and ways to continue its momentum through an extended network of policy actors and analysts.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The hybrid event brought together more than 250 stakeholders, including representatives from the Viet Nam Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Cambodia Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Irrigation (MoALI) Myanmar, regional farmer organizations, research institutions, donors, and civil society. Following are highlights from key speakers:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Shahidur Rashid, IFPRI South Asia Director, said the project has done remarkably well on generating evidence, fostering partnership and in developing outreach with ASEAN country policymakers. “The evidence that we have generated and partnership we have established with national institutions needs continued engagement,” Rashid said. To sustain the project’s work and momentum, and facilitate continuing policy dialogues and stakeholder engagement, he said, organizers are setting up a Network of Policy Advisors and Analysts in the ASEAN region (NePAAA).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Tran Cong Thang, Director-General, Institute of Policy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development (IPSARD) emphasized that the project’s research findings and policy recommendations are particularly timely for ASEAN countries, as the region continues the process of economic integration—for example, using economic integration as a development strategy, participating in evolving global value chains and emerging large trading arrangements like Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        the project has developed national and regional roadmaps for ASEAN countries; the latter aim to enhance cooperation among AMS through strategic programs and measures in the areas of R&D, food safety and quality standards, and investments in agrifood enterprises.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Glenn B. Gregorio, Director, Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA), said: “As we showcase evidence-based policy insights best practices and roadmap recommendation to promote small holders’ inclusiveness … the pandemic has highlighted the need for agricultural transformation and market integration.” Member states must continue to communicate and have friendly competition based on improving productivity, and strengthen their collaborative efforts, he said.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Roehlano M. Briones, Senior Research Fellow, Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), who led the maize and meat regional roadmap exercises, shared some of the resulting recommendations. Integrated investments along the maize and meat value chain, along with public private farmer partnerships, should be encouraged, he stressed, and small farmer organizations and especially small farmers themselves included in these partnerships.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        “We need to create a viable system for addressing transboundary concerns related to plant animal and human health. Mainstreaming regional cooperation is something that is quite crucial’ to guide and energize the continued growth and emergence of a region rich intra ASEAN regional trade in maize and meat.” Briones said.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Abdel Karim Sma, IFAD Lead Regional Economist, stressed that the project’s evidence demonstrates participating countries are moving in the right direction. However, stakeholders will have to work together to build on the evidence to develop a coherent roadmap.\n“I would say integration in the ASEAN countries is not a luxury but critical necessity. We are witnessing transformation of inherently complex food systems against the backdrop of a heightened turbulence and impact of climate change,” said Sma.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        A key component of the project focused on the market integration of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Viet Nam, and the Philippines with ASEAN and its other top trading partners. The studies conducted for the project have found that the exports of all AMS are competitive in ASEAN markets and have high export potential. The findings suggest countries should target commodities and markets in which export potential is high and measured competition is low to achieve higher returns for agricultural producers.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        ATMI-ASEAN analyses suggest that structural transformation in the project focal countries is positively driven by agricultural productivity, terms of trade, and public investments in infrastructure, with little role for rural to urban migration or market integration. Efficient, sustainable, and inclusive growth requires more investment in agricultural research and extension systems; and diversifying production portfolios toward higher-value food commodities, by strengthening institutions that link farmers to more profitable markets. Investing in post-harvest infrastructure for food processing is also essential.\n    </p>\n    <p>Rebika Laishram is a Senior Communications Specialist with IFPRI South Asia.</p>\n</article>\n","categories":["posts"]},{"title":"Gender-informed policies fundamental for climate change adaptation","url":"/acticle/gender-informed-policies-fundamental-for-climate-change-adaptation/","content":"\n<article id=\"events_blog\">\n    <h3>\n        Gender-informed policies fundamental for climate change adaptation\n    </h3>\n    <div>Reducing the gender gap in Ethiopian farming households can enhance climate change adaptation by female-headed households by almost 19%.</div>\n    <section class=\"article_description\">\n        <div>\n            <span class=\"p_bold\">\n                Author\n            </span>\n            <span>\n                : Sarah McLaughlin\n            </span>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <span class=\"p_bold\">\n                Source\n            </span>\n            <span>\n                : <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cimmyt.org/news/gender-informed-policies-fundamental-for-climate-change-adaptation/\">\n                    https://www.cimmyt.org/news/gender-informed-policies-fundamental-for-climate-change-adaptation/\n                </a>\n            </span>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n    <p>\n        Scientists from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) are working to understand the gender gap in climate change adaptations and the causes behind this disparity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Using data from 2,279 farm households in Ethiopia, the results show a significant gap due to the observable and unobservable different characteristics of households headed by men and women.

To climatologists, 452 adds up to climate change. To farmers around the world, that translates to a lot of really bad weather. To those in Somalia, that very well could mean a famine this year. In any case, it contributes to a global food crisis — and one which all the world’s countries must address. \n</p>\n    <p>\n        On behalf of the president, Secretary of State Antony Blinken did just that when he joined world leaders at the Global Food Security Summit in New York on Sept. 20 at the United Nations General Assembly.  At this gathering, he challenged global partners to take the needed actions to combat the negative impacts of conflict and climate change on food security. \n</p>\n    <p>\n        Climate change has arrived. During the 1980s, there were fewer than three natural disasters per year in the United States that cost roughly $1 billion each in damage (inflation adjusted). In contrast, there were 20 such natural disasters in the last year.\n</p>\n    <p>\n        Credible projections indicate that by mid-century in many countries, the best growing seasons temperature-wise will closely resemble the worst of the past.        \n</p>\n    <p>\n        Globally, 193 million people face acute food insecurity. This year’s projected budget shortfall for the World Food Program exceeds last year’s entire budget. The World Food Program executive director recently remarked that the organization is being forced to make an agonizing decision — “to take food from hungry children to give it to starving children.” And we’re only beginning to feel the full effects of climate change.\n</p>\n    <p>\n        The United States is providing an unprecedented amount of food aid and humanitarian assistance and is the World Food Program’s largest donor. But make no mistake, these efforts are neither enough to resolve the current crisis nor prevent another. Food aid, regardless of the amount, is not and cannot be the only means to address food insecurity. There is no formula for determining the best balance of using available resources for immediate humanitarian aid and boosting food production (reducing the need for aid), but we know improving food systems is the answer. Most countries — 131 of 196 — are net food importers.\n</p>\n    <p>\n       Reliable local production, well-functioning markets, strong, responsive democracies, and open international trade are essential to strengthening food systems, especially in countries that are currently food insecure.\n</p>\n    <p>\n        Vladimir Putin bears responsibility for exacerbating a global food crisis that was already well underway thanks to his decision to launch an all-out invasion of Ukraine, a top five supplier of wheat, corn, and vegetable oil to world markets. What happens in Ukraine doesn’t stay in Ukraine. Rising prices downstream of Russia’s full-scale war have pushed millions more around the globe into food insecurity. \n</p>\n    <p>\n        This food security crisis is unlike any of the past, as it is the result of multiple major causes, notably climate change, COVID-19, and global conflict. More than half of those experiencing hunger today live in conflict zones. Historically low grain stockpiles, high fertilizer prices, limited fertilizer availability, and food export restrictions imposed by about 20 countries also add to the list of causes. Moreover, 21 of the world’s 37 major aquifers are in decline. The Ganges and the Arabian aquifer systems, both sources of water for irrigation, are among those suffering serious depletion.\n</p>\n    <p>This is a multi-year crisis. Due to the many factors at play and the need for multiple growing seasons to restore supplies and markets, there are no quick or easy solutions. The fight against hunger must be conducted with a long-term perspective and on multiple fronts.\n</p>\n<p>The U.S. government is engaged with a multi-year strategy that seeks to create food systems that are inclusive, resilient, and sustainable. We have expanded Feed the Future, the U.S. government’s flagship global hunger and food security initiative, to eight new countries, all in Africa. The United States is providing support to institutions such as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, which are contributing significantly to global food security. The Center’s drought-tolerant corn is now planted on 17 million acres in Africa. \n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://wp-img.daozhao.com.cn/thefoodsecurity/article/d14fb34b-badb-4f41-85bb-0d403d72f2c8-GTY_1238828893.webp\">\n<div class=\"figure_text_after_img\" data-c-caption=\"People wait in a line with groceries at the supermarket on Feb. 28, 2022 in Kyiv, Ukraine.\" data-c-credit=\"Anastasia Vlasova, Getty Images\"></div>\n</figure>\n<p>We must ensure that all crops important to food security receive adequate research funding and are “climate ready” to increase production, provide more farmer income, better nutrition, and heightened resilience both to weather extremes and geopolitical shocks. This makes humanitarian and economic sense and is in everyone’s self-interest. Ask any farmer anywhere.\n</p>\n<p>This investment in research also makes sense from a national security perspective, as conflict is both a cause and effect of food insecurity. Intensifying climate change and hunger increase the risk of conflict.\n</p>\n<p>Strengthening global food systems not only advances peace abroad but also helps our own farmers here at home. For wheat alone, every two cents invested by U.S. taxpayers generates one hundred dollars of benefit to our economy. And how does it impact the hungry? USAID programs, to cite but one example, have prevented 3.4 million children in target countries from being stunted.\n</p>\n<p>When we choose to invest in global food security, we all benefit. In joining world leaders at the United Nations to address food insecurity, we will leverage our investment and put America in the lead where it must be. </p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://wp-img.daozhao.com.cn/thefoodsecurity/article/77a54f58-5e24-40bb-9b09-42f4693d3a20-Cary_Fowler2007_2236237.webp\">\n<div class=\"figure_text_after_img\" data-c-caption=\"February 2008 - Cary Fowler, a 1967 White Station High School graduate, not far from the arctic seed vault near Svalbard, Norway.\" data-c-credit=\"CommercialAppeal.com\"></div>\n</figure>\n<p>Cary Fowler is U.S. special envoy for global food security.</p>\n\n</article>\n","categories":["posts"]}]
