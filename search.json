This year marks the 3rd anniversary of the Global Food Security Association for Young Scientists (GFSAYS), which was jointly founded by Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO). The association, as an international exchange platform, aims to connect young scientists focusing on food security issues from various disciplines.\n\nThe 2024 forum will be hosted by HZAU, with the theme of “Enhancing Youth Power for Global Food Security”.\n\nEnhancing youth power is not merely a choice but a necessity in securing global food stability. With an ever-growing population and the looming threat of climate change, the agricultural sector faces unprecedented challenges. Empowering the youth, who represent the future custodians of our planet, is paramount. Their innovative perspectives, creative ideas, and technological adeptness are invaluable assets in revolutionizing agricultural practices for sustainability and resilience. Moreover, investing in youth education, training, and employment opportunities in agriculture not only addresses unemployment but also cultivates a skilled workforce equipped to tackle the complexities of modern food production.

</p>\n\n记者：如何强化科技战略支撑、实现为油料产业发展赋能？\n\n李谷成：端稳端牢“油瓶子”，根本出路在科技。目前，农业机械和种子技术的发展对油料产业至为重要，重点要推动重点领域关键核心技术的新突破。一方面，加快培育高产高油大豆、短生育期油菜、耐盐碱作物等新品种；另一方面，加快玉米大豆生物育种的产业化步伐，有序扩大试点范围。此外，需要重点支持玉米大豆带状复合种植专用机械和低损失率油菜籽收获机械技术的技术攻关。\n\n记者：我国耕地总量少，质量总体不高，后备资源不足。在此背景下，如何保障大豆等油料作物的供给？\n\n李谷成：保障大豆等油料作物的供给，要大力推进大豆玉米带状复合种植，稳步开发盐碱地种植大豆。首先，扎实推进大豆玉米带状复合种植，利用间作套种方式，实现“玉米不减产，多收一季豆”，在保证玉米产量稳定的同时提升大豆产量。其次，支持东北、黄淮海地区开展粮豆轮作，发挥大豆固氮肥田的作用，改善土壤结构，提高土壤营养状态。最后，加快耐盐碱大豆品种的培育和降低盐碱地含盐量技术的攻关，充分利用盐碱地种植大豆等农作物，向我国15亿亩盐碱地“挖潜找油”。\n\n记者：“十分珍惜和合理利用每一寸土地,切实保护耕地”是我国一项基本国策。如何在保障油料作物稳定供给的同时，提高土地资源的利用率？\n\n李谷成：利用冬闲田种植油菜，可有效提高土地资源的利用率。我国是油菜生产和消费第一大国，种植面积超1亿亩、占油料面积的50%以上。而与大豆、花生等油料不同，冬油菜的最大优势是不与粮争地。广泛分布于长江流域和云贵地区的冬油菜生育期一般在200天左右，通常在10月播种，次年4-5月可收获。油菜收获后恰好赶上水稻种植，秋后水稻收割后又正好赶上油菜秋播，稻油、稻稻油轮作已经成为冬油菜主产区的主要种植模式。因此，加大综合性措施扶持力度，大力开发冬闲田种植油菜，有利于提高土地利用效率和油料的稳产保供。\n\n记者：除在生产供给端保障油料作物的稳产供给外，在保障国家粮油安全中，消费者可以发挥怎样的作用？\n\n李谷成：受饮食和消费习惯等因素的影响，目前我国居民食用油和“红肉”的人均消费量实际上已经超过了膳食指南推荐标准的约1倍和2倍。这既容易引发高血脂高血压等疾病，也大大增加了大豆油料的供给压力。因此，除了生产供给端外，消费需求端也大有文章可做。\n\n对此，我国应加大膳食营养宣传力度，提倡健康饮食新风尚。不仅要制止“舌尖上的浪费”，树立节约减损就是增产的概念，推进全链条节约减损；还应进一步加强膳食营养宣传力度，比如：提倡健康饮食新风尚，包括改变烹饪方式，控制油脂和红肉的摄入量等。\n\n（中国日报湖北记者站

如何抓住技术变革机遇、加快农业强国建设？近日，华中农业大学经济管理学院教授、华中农业大学宏观农业研究院副院长熊航就此问题接受了《中国日报》的专访。\n\n熊航表示，当前，人工智能、大数据等新兴技术在以前所未有的力度变革农业，不仅极大地提高了农业生产操作的效率，而且推动农业经营决策方式从以经验为基础的决策向数据驱动的智能化决策转变。“在农业农村数字化和智能化背景下，我国加快建设农业强国正当其时。”熊航认为，当下需要更加重视补齐关键科技短板、激发各类要素活力，努力提升中国农业的国际竞争力。\n\n <p class=\"post_flex_center_center post_flex_p\">\n     <img src=\"https://img3.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202305/04/645346e8a3105379f5712c26.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />\n </p>\n\n《中国日报》：加快建设农业强国，尽快补齐农业领域关键科技短板是必由之路。如何补短板、强基础？\n\n熊航：农业的发展始终以科技的进步为支撑，建国以来，我国农业经历了从机械化到信息化，再向智能化发展的历程。当前，我国与世界农业科技强国还有明显的差距，必须加快补齐农业科技短板，实现农业高水平科技自立自强。近年来，我国农业科技创新能力稳步提升，但核心种源、先进装备等领域存在差距。弥补我国农业科技上的短板要尊重农业特点，为关键领域农业基础研究提供长期性、持续性支持。强化涉农高校院所的基础研究条件建设，构建与学科体系相匹配的科技创新平台体系，为持续开展基础性、前沿性研究创造条件。\n\n值得注意的是，农业软件（模型）是我国农业智能化过程中的一个薄弱环节。农业模型是智能决策决策支持系统的内核，然而基于我国本土条件开发的模型无论是内部机理的合理性还是所覆盖的农产品类型和种类都存在明显缺陷。政府需要加大农业科技领域基础研究投入，设置农业模型研制与开发专项，同时大力培养既懂农业又具有较强建模能力的学生。\n\n《中国日报》：当前以人工智能、大数据为代表的新兴技术正迅速渗透至各行各业，农业亦不例外。如何激发包括人才、技术、数据在内的各类要素的活力？\n\n熊航：突破关键核心技术，关键在于有效发挥科研人员的积极性。当前，农业科研人员开展原创性科技创新和成果转化的积极性还没有充分激发出来。要实行以增加知识价值为导向的分配政策，构建体现智力劳动价值的薪酬体系和收入增长机制，打通农业科技成果转化的“最后一公里”。\n\n随着数字经济蓬勃发展，数据资源逐步成为重要的生产要素。首先需要建立数据要素参与农业生产经营成果分配的制度。只有数据所有者参与农业生产经营利润的分配机制建立起来，才能广泛、持续地调动各类农业参与主体获取和提供高质量数据、充分地利用数据创造价值的积极性。此外，既盘活存量又优化增量，构建农业知识图谱以打通信息“孤岛”。首先在不改变现有数据资源的权属与管理格局的前提下实现数据之间的逻辑互联，建立农业农村政务信息资源的共享交换机制，进而与行业企业数据、科研机构数据实现互通有无。\n\n《中国日报》：如何提升中国农业的国际竞争力？\n\n熊航：作为全球最大农产品生产国和重要农产品贸易进出口国，提升农业的国际竞争力是我国建设农业强国题中应有之义。一方面，要优化农产品进出口结构，提升应对国际市场冲击和突发事件保障能力。为确保未来粮食安全主动权牢牢掌握在自己手上，有必要对国内农产品需求进行多维的区间把握，及时分析国内农产品的消费结构和预测农产品消费趋势，适度扩大刚需型食物和农业原料进口，推动优质农产品的进口，满足我国食物消费市场和食物消费多元需求。深入实施农产品进口多元化战略以应对当前全球疫情、气候变化、俄乌冲突对粮食安全造成的影响，增加农产品进口种类，拓展我国农产品进口渠道，多渠道保障我国的粮食安全。\n\n另一方面，要借鉴农业进出口大国发展经验，探索实行更为积极主动的粮食安全保障政策。此外，需要进一步加强“一带一路”沿线国家农业合作。加强沿线国家农业合作战略对接，兼顾各方利益和诉求，支持进出口贸易便利化，进一步优化进出口贸易措施，消除贸易壁垒。同时，以农业科技交流合作为先导，深化新亚欧大陆桥、中蒙俄、中国-中亚-西亚、中国-中南半岛、中巴、孟中印缅等六大经济走廊的农业贸易投资合作。\n\n（中国日报湖北记者站

Women and girls also face a disproportionate burden from shocks, such as those driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the current food and cost-of-living crisis. Women and girls are more likely to face food insecurity and malnutrition—in 2021, at least 126 million more women than men experienced food insecurity, a gap that continues to grow.\n\nGlobal food system organizations are critical to advancing gender equality and building women’s empowerment. But how do their own workplace practices measure up? The Global Food 50/50 initiative, a collaboration between Global Health 50/50, IFPRI, and UN Women, assesses how well these organizations perform on gender equality, with the goal of building more effective organizations—and ultimately more equitable and sustainable food systems. Hungry for Gender Equality, the initiative’s second annual report, reviews the gender and equity policies and practices of 51 major organizations, complementing the leadership analysis with a focus on the board members of governing bodies.\n\nThe launch event, held October 18 as part of the World Food Prize 2022 Borlaug Dialogue virtual side-events, presented major findings from the report and explored potential for future progress. In his opening remarks, Johan Swinnen, CGIAR’s Managing Director for Systems Transformation and IFPRI’s Director General, emphasized the risks facing women: “On the brink of COP27, as the global community comes together to design, implement, and monitor crisis responses, these solutions must provide resources to help women and girls cope with crisis in the short term and challenge the systems that perpetuate inequality.”\n\nSarah Hendriks, Director of the Policy, Programme, and Intergovernmental Division at UN Women, underscored how food systems embed multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination against women and girls. “Now is the time for collective, decisive action and accountability,” she said.\n\nIn his keynote address, Ambassador Gabriel Ferrero, Chair of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), discussed the importance of the Global Food 50/50 report to the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s and Girls’ Empowerment in the Context of Food Security and Nutrition, which are currently being negotiated by member states.\n\n“Global Food 50/50 is not just a report—it is both an accountability and a change mechanism,” said Jemimah Njuki, Chief of Economic Empowerment at UN Women. Sonja Tanaka, Deputy Director of Global Health 50/50, presented in-depth findings from this year’s report. Although public commitment to gender equality remains high, nearly half of organizations in the report’s sample lack transparent plans for diversity and inclusion, and half have more men than women in leadership bodies. Most board seats are occupied by nationals from high-income countries, and 70% of CEOs and board chairs are men. Of the 351 board seats assessed in the report, only 2% are held by women from low-income countries.\n\nIn the panel discussion moderated by Hazel Malapit, Senior Research Coordinator at IFPRI, representatives from civil society organizations, development partners, and policymakers highlighted the critical importance of gender equality, both to food systems as a whole and to organizations and their programming.\n\nWithin the informal sector, women working in the food supply chain face unique risks related to climate change and markets. Megha Desai, Senior Coordinator for the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in India, noted that the sector’s contribution to food systems is “invisible but vital,” and called for action and research targeting women’s needs.\n\nMartha Nyagaya, the Country Director for Kenya at Nutrition International (NI), emphasized the interconnections between food security, nutrition, and gender. “At NI, we try to achieve an equitable, inclusive organization that confronts and addresses gender equity by promoting diversity in our governance structures in leadership and decision-making, but, most importantly, in our programs,” she explained.\n\nFrom the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Benjamin Davis, Director of FAO’s Inclusive Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division, discussed recent progress in achieving workplace gender equality, as well as future goals. He commended the GF5050 initiative, saying “the report is a much-needed resource for the global response to gender inequality at the highest institutional level. The fight is not over, and it needs to happen at all levels, from the boardroom to communities to within families.”\n\nMaura Barry, the Senior Deputy Assistant to the Administrator for USAID’s Bureau for Resilience and Food Security, highlighted recent White House and USAID initiatives to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. “We know that gender equality and women’s empowerment can help eradicate poverty, build vibrant economies, and unlock potential on a transformational scale,” she said, further noting that “if women are not involved in developing and implementing solutions, our work will not be as impactful and sustainable as it could be”.\n\nIn closing remarks, Sarah Hawkes, Co-Founder and Co-Director of Global Health 50/50, reflected on the many crises facing the world’s women. She emphasized that “words on paper” mean nothing without implementation, saying “Accountability mechanisms like this report make sure that those great words on paper are actually measured and monitored.”\n\nClaire Davis is a Senior Editor with IFPRI's Communications and Public Affairs Division.\n","categories":["blogs"]},{"title":"Keep calm and trade on: China’s decisive role in agricultural markets under turmoil","url":"/acticle/keep-calm-and-trade-on-chinas-decisive-role-in-agricultural-markets-under-turmoil/","content":"\n### Keep calm and trade on: China’s decisive role in agricultural markets under turmoil ###\n\n> Author : IAMO\n> Source : https://www.iamo.de/en/press/press-releases/article/keep-calm-and-trade-on-chinas-decisive-role-in-agricultural-markets-under-turmoil/\n\nChina is the world’s largest consumer and importer of agricultural goods. As a result, its trade strategies influence international markets and affect consumers worldwide. However, rising domestic demand for food and limited land and water resources are posing a particular challenge to China’s food security. This is exacerbated by world market price volatility resulting from recent geopolitical tensions, the Covid-19 pandemic, and extreme weather events caused by climate change. The Chinese government has turned to a range of measures to overcome these challenges, including building up immense strategic reserves. In [IAMO Policy Brief 45](https://www.iamo.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Bilder_und_Dokumente/05-publikationen/IAMO_Policy_Brief/IAMO_Policy_Brief_45_EN.pdf) Lena Kuhn, Tinoush Jamali Jaghdani, Sören Prehn, Zhanli Sun and Thomas Glauben take a look at these developments and how they affect global markets.\n\nAs the world’s largest consumer and importer of agricultural goods, China has significant influence over world markets. In 2021, China’s imports of agricultural products exceeded its exports by a factor of 2.6 to reach USD 219.8 billion. As China’s middle class grows so too does its domestic demand for high-quality food and, in particular, meat and dairy products. However, both require more land and water resources than the grains and vegetables consumed as part of traditional diets.\n\nAt the same time, production resources are stretching thin. For example, China has 20% of the world’s population but less than 7% of the global freshwater supply, making it one of the most water-scarce countries in the world. For decades, Chinese agricultural policy has therefore focused on increasing agricultural productivity, in particular via higher inputs of fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation, coming at the cost of arable land and water resources.\n\nIt is estimated that the current nutritional transition in China will require an additional three to 12 million hectares of land between 2020 and 2050. This will be difficult to meet, as China is already struggling to maintain its current farmland area.\n\nOn 11 June 2022, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) launched a rural investment program to stabilise grain production and expand soybean and oilseed production. This included the use of “smart” grain storage.\n\nIn 2021, China had 142 million metric tons of wheat stocks. This means that while China has 20% of the world’s population, it likely holds more than 50% of the world’s total wheat stocks as a reserve. The same can be observed for corn, which is used mainly in animal feed. China is a key producer of corn, with a self-sufficiency rate of 95.8%. However, it is also the world’s largest net importer of corn. At the end of the last season, China held 210 million metric tons of corn stocks, which accounted for more than two-thirds (68%) of global reserves.\n\nChina’s current high demand for strategic agricultural products is often viewed as a reaction to short-term shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic and, most recently, the war in Ukraine. However, it is more likely a response to long-term macrotrends, particularly those caused by climate change, population growth and higher consumption of animal proteins. Considerable parts of China’s population have reached higher income levels, and demand for food on world markets will therefore continue to increase steadily. It is not clear whether productivity gains can keep pace in the face of climate change and scarce water resources.\n\nComplete self-sufficiency in terms of major food products may be China’s goal, but it can’t be achieved without resource depletion and massive losses in welfare and quality of life. To master the coming challenges, China will have to participate in international markets to share various production, price and logistics risks. International agricultural trade is essential for China to ensure its own food security.\n\nAccording to IAMO Director Thomas Glauben, “International agricultural trade remains the key to global food security. Not only poorer countries in the Global South but also main economic actors like China and Germany must participate in international agricultural trade, especially in times of crisis, to ensure their populations have sufficient access to nutritious foods.”\n","categories":["blogs"]},{"title":"Global trade not self-sufficiency is key to overcoming food shortages in times of war and crisis","url":"/acticle/global-trade-not-self-sufficiency-is-key-to-overcoming-food-shortages-in-times-of-war-and-crisis/","content":"\n### Global trade not self-sufficiency is key to overcoming food shortages in times of war and crisis ###\n\nIAMO Policy Brief 45 looks at how China is ensuring its domestic food security in the face of recent crises\n\n> Author : IAMO\n> Source : https://www.iamo.de/en/press/press-releases/article/global-trade-not-self-sufficiency-is-key-to-overcoming-food-shortages-in-times-of-war-and-crisis/\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has sent prices soaring for agricultural commodities such as grains, vegetable oils and fertilizers. This could destabilize food security, particularly in import-dependent countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA region). In the latest [IAMO Policy Brief 44](https://www.iamo.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Bilder_und_Dokumente/05-publikationen/IAMO_Policy_Brief/IAMO_Policy_Brief_44_ENG.pdf) , Thomas Glauben, Miranda Svanidze, Linde Götz, Sören Prehn, Tinoush Jamali Jaghdani, Ivan Duric and Lena Kuhn assess the current situation on the global wheat market.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has aggravated existing tensions on global food markets that can likely be traced back to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since late 2021, prices for agricultural commodities such as grains and vegetable oils have reached record highs, surpassing even the levels of the global food price crises of more than a decade ago. Now, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sent prices soaring even higher. This risks destabilizing food security in import-dependent countries with low per capita incomes, especially in the MENA region and sub-Saharan Africa, that source their wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Disruptions to exports from the Black Sea Region and high prices are further compounding the already critical food situation in these regions.\n\nHowever, global demand for wheat is expected to be met in the current marketing year and countries such as India, the USA and Australia will increase exports to fill the supply gap left by Russia and Ukraine. It is difficult to predict what will happen beyond this marketing year, as this will be determined by the development of the current conflict in addition to agricultural fundamentals in key supply and demand regions. However, preliminary forecasts do not predict dramatic changes in the global trade volumes of key agricultural commodities in the coming marketing year. Nevertheless, international agricultural trade flows may have to adapt, which could have negative consequences. Prices are not expected to fall any time soon and consumers, particularly in developing countries, will be expected to carry the burden. European agriculture and consumers are not predicted to experience any major changes in the medium term.\n\nOpen and competitive global trade is needed to overcome (potential) trade disruptions and create supply structures that can easily adapt to shocks, no matter the cause. Calls to move towards a centrally planned economy, isolation or self-sufficiency are strongly advised against, as this would only be to the detriment of food security in the Global South.\n\n“Even if exports from other countries can offset trade disruptions in the Black Sea Region, geopolitical efforts must be made to ensure that Ukraine and Russia remain key parts of the world agricultural trading system. This is the only way to achieve global food security. Their high production and export potential bolsters the ‘safety net of international agricultural trade’ and contributes significantly to combating hunger in the Global South,” says IAMO Director Thomas Glauben.\n","categories":["blogs"]},{"title":"Bringing voluntary carbon offset markets to smallholder Indian farmers","url":"/acticle/bringing-voluntary-carbon-offset-markets-to-smallholder-indian-farmers/","content":"\n### Bringing voluntary carbon offset markets to smallholder Indian farmers ###\nCIMMYT and ICAR partner to reward Indian farmers for utilizing climate smart agricultural practices.\n\n>Author : John Bakum\n>Source : https://www.cimmyt.org/news/bringing-voluntary-carbon-offset-markets-to-smallholder-indian-farmers/\n\nTo mitigate their amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, companies and individuals have access to international voluntary carbon offset markets, which are trading systems that financially compensate credit producer participants for offsetting the amount of carbon emitted. An innovative new initiative from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR) is working to establish carbon markets among smallholder farmers in India, with the goal of reducing GHG emissions, encouraging climate smart farming practices through financial incentives.\n\nIn India, agriculture is one of the biggest sources of GHG emissions – between 14 and 21 percent of all GHGs are attributable to agricultural activities, which derive from the use of farm machinery, rice cultivation, fertilizer use, and other activities. Emissions from agriculture are increasing drastically due to synthetic fertilizers and enteric fermentation from livestock.\n\nWithin CIMMYT’s farmer-centered approach, participants in voluntary carbon markets will improve their own financial viability in two ways – through adopting sustainable practices and through receipt of payments from carbon markets. The approach will also employ regenerative interventions such as direct dry seeding of rice, minimal tillage, crop diversification, use of biofertilizers, and perennial cropping all while contributing to an overall reduction in GHG emissions.\n\n“Working with ICAR to engage smallholder farmers with high-quality carbon offsets allows the farmers to offset their unavoidable emissions,” said Vijesh Krishna, senior CIMMYT scientist. “This program promotes inclusiveness because this newly created income is distributed among participating farmers, thereby improving their income.”\n\nThese regenerative agriculture interventions will increase and retain soil’s carbon content, water permeability and retention, resulting in crops’ ability to withstand drought, flooding, and temperature stresses. Only a small percentage of farmers currently implement these methods in India.\n\nCIMMYT and ICAR researchers estimate that widespread adoption of these practices, combined with upgraded technologies, has the potential to return the carbon levels in agricultural soils from an average of 0.5 percent back to 1.5 percent. At present, the agricultural soils of India are poor with respect to soil organic carbon.\n\n**Carbon markets for smallholders**\n\nAbout 2,000 small holder farmers of Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Maharashtra, all in India, are enrolled in the project through individual partnership agreements. Once farmers implement regenerative agricultural methods, they will be eligible to receive payments for carbon credits generated for 10 to 20 years, conditional upon continuing to use climate-smart practices.\n\n“We believe these efforts can be expanded to other regions of India, and other countries,” said Sieg Snapp, CIMMYT’s Sustainable Agrifood Systems (SAS) program director. “Helping farmers and reducing GHG emissions at the same time is the way forward in dealing the crisis of climate change.”\n\nFarms are geo-tagged and monitored using remote sensing for regenerative farming practices, and soil carbon content will be measured at the beginning and end of the crop cycle. Those that produce rice and wheat with a lower carbon footprint will be identified, so their produce gets purchase and price preferences from those who want to promote lower carbon agriculture.\n\nDigital agronomy tools and satellite imagery analysis to measure and verify soil carbon offsets and on-farm GHG emission levels are essential for scaling small farmer-centered carbon projects. The veracity, transparency, and traceability of each carbon offset have direct implications for its credibility and actual market value. CIMMYT will contribute towards a Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) platform to expand climate action country-wide.\n\nSo far, CIMMYT and ICAR researchers estimate that the enrolled smallholder famers have sequestered between four and five tons of carbon dioxide. After independent third-party auditors verify the data, farmers will be paid based on the amount of GHG reduction, with the first carbon offset payments expected to be issued in 2023.\n\n**People**\nSieglinde Snapp\nVijesh V.

Yet many food system challenges remain, driven by effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising global food prices, and other problems. ASEAN food value chains are growing more internationalized in an environment of global economic stresses and uncertainty, raising questions about how best to achieve structural change.\n\nThe recently-concluded Agricultural Transformation and Market Integration in the ASEAN region (ATMI-ASEAN) project, launched in 2016, focused on strengthening member states’ capacity to develop effective food security and agricultural policies. On June 1-2, project participants and experts met in a high-level policy forum in Hanoi to discuss the project’s five years of rigorous research studies, and ways to continue its momentum through an extended network of policy actors and analysts.\n\nThe hybrid event brought together more than 250 stakeholders, including representatives from the Viet Nam Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Cambodia Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Irrigation (MoALI) Myanmar, regional farmer organizations, research institutions, donors, and civil society. Following are highlights from key speakers:\n\nShahidur Rashid, IFPRI South Asia Director, said the project has done remarkably well on generating evidence, fostering partnership and in developing outreach with ASEAN country policymakers. “The evidence that we have generated and partnership we have established with national institutions needs continued engagement,” Rashid said. To sustain the project’s work and momentum, and facilitate continuing policy dialogues and stakeholder engagement, he said, organizers are setting up a Network of Policy Advisors and Analysts in the ASEAN region (NePAAA).\n\nTran Cong Thang, Director-General, Institute of Policy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development (IPSARD) emphasized that the project’s research findings and policy recommendations are particularly timely for ASEAN countries, as the region continues the process of economic integration—for example, using economic integration as a development strategy, participating in evolving global value chains and emerging large trading arrangements like Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\n\nthe project has developed national and regional roadmaps for ASEAN countries; the latter aim to enhance cooperation among AMS through strategic programs and measures in the areas of R&D, food safety and quality standards, and investments in agrifood enterprises.\n\nGlenn B. Gregorio, Director, Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA), said: “As we showcase evidence-based policy insights best practices and roadmap recommendation to promote small holders’ inclusiveness … the pandemic has highlighted the need for agricultural transformation and market integration.” Member states must continue to communicate and have friendly competition based on improving productivity, and strengthen their collaborative efforts, he said.\n\nRoehlano M. Briones, Senior Research Fellow, Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), who led the maize and meat regional roadmap exercises, shared some of the resulting recommendations. Integrated investments along the maize and meat value chain, along with public private farmer partnerships, should be encouraged, he stressed, and small farmer organizations and especially small farmers themselves included in these partnerships.\n\n“We need to create a viable system for addressing transboundary concerns related to plant animal and human health. Mainstreaming regional cooperation is something that is quite crucial’ to guide and energize the continued growth and emergence of a region rich intra ASEAN regional trade in maize and meat.” Briones said.\n\nAbdel Karim Sma, IFAD Lead Regional Economist, stressed that the project’s evidence demonstrates participating countries are moving in the right direction. However, stakeholders will have to work together to build on the evidence to develop a coherent roadmap. “I would say integration in the ASEAN countries is not a luxury but critical necessity. We are witnessing transformation of inherently complex food systems against the backdrop of a heightened turbulence and impact of climate change,” said Sma.\n\nA key component of the project focused on the market integration of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Viet Nam, and the Philippines with ASEAN and its other top trading partners. The studies conducted for the project have found that the exports of all AMS are competitive in ASEAN markets and have high export potential. The findings suggest countries should target commodities and markets in which export potential is high and measured competition is low to achieve higher returns for agricultural producers.\n\nATMI-ASEAN analyses suggest that structural transformation in the project focal countries is positively driven by agricultural productivity, terms of trade, and public investments in infrastructure, with little role for rural to urban migration or market integration. Efficient, sustainable, and inclusive growth requires more investment in agricultural research and extension systems; and diversifying production portfolios toward higher-value food commodities, by strengthening institutions that link farmers to more profitable markets. Investing in post-harvest infrastructure for food processing is also essential.\n\nRebika Laishram is a Senior Communications Specialist with IFPRI South Asia.\n","categories":["blogs"]},{"title":"Gender-informed policies fundamental for climate change adaptation","url":"/acticle/gender-informed-policies-fundamental-for-climate-change-adaptation/","content":"\n### Gender-informed policies fundamental for climate change adaptation ###\n\nReducing the gender gap in Ethiopian farming households can enhance climate change adaptation by female-headed households by almost 19%.\n\n> Author : Sarah McLaughlin\n> Source : https://www.cimmyt.org/news/gender-informed-policies-fundamental-for-climate-change-adaptation/\n\nScientists from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) are working to understand the gender gap in climate change adaptations and the causes behind this disparity.\n\nUsing data from 2,279 farm households in Ethiopia, the results show a significant gap due to the observable and unobservable different characteristics of households headed by men and women. For example, women are less likely to adopt climate change adaptation measures due to their workload in household chores. However, evidence suggests that when the gender gap shrinks, climate change adaptation can be improved in female-headed households by almost 19%.\n\nThe study determined that policies must tackle unobservable characteristics in order to address the gender gap.

To climatologists, 452 adds up to climate change. To farmers around the world, that translates to a lot of really bad weather. To those in Somalia, that very well could mean a famine this year. In any case, it contributes to a global food crisis — and one which all the world’s countries must address.\n\nOn behalf of the president, Secretary of State Antony Blinken did just that when he joined world leaders at the Global Food Security Summit in New York on Sept. 20 at the United Nations General Assembly. At this gathering, he challenged global partners to take the needed actions to combat the negative impacts of conflict and climate change on food security.\n\nClimate change has arrived. During the 1980s, there were fewer than three natural disasters per year in the United States that cost roughly $1 billion each in damage (inflation adjusted). In contrast, there were 20 such natural disasters in the last year.\n\nCredible projections indicate that by mid-century in many countries, the best growing seasons temperature-wise will closely resemble the worst of the past.\n\nGlobally, 193 million people face acute food insecurity. This year’s projected budget shortfall for the World Food Program exceeds last year’s entire budget. The World Food Program executive director recently remarked that the organization is being forced to make an agonizing decision — “to take food from hungry children to give it to starving children.” And we’re only beginning to feel the full effects of climate change.\n\nThe United States is providing an unprecedented amount of food aid and humanitarian assistance and is the World Food Program’s largest donor. But make no mistake, these efforts are neither enough to resolve the current crisis nor prevent another. Food aid, regardless of the amount, is not and cannot be the only means to address food insecurity. There is no formula for determining the best balance of using available resources for immediate humanitarian aid and boosting food production (reducing the need for aid), but we know improving food systems is the answer. Most countries — 131 of 196 — are net food importers.\n\nReliable local production, well-functioning markets, strong, responsive democracies, and open international trade are essential to strengthening food systems, especially in countries that are currently food insecure.\n\nVladimir Putin bears responsibility for exacerbating a global food crisis that was already well underway thanks to his decision to launch an all-out invasion of Ukraine, a top five supplier of wheat, corn, and vegetable oil to world markets. What happens in Ukraine doesn’t stay in Ukraine. Rising prices downstream of Russia’s full-scale war have pushed millions more around the globe into food insecurity.\n\nThis food security crisis is unlike any of the past, as it is the result of multiple major causes, notably climate change, COVID-19, and global conflict. More than half of those experiencing hunger today live in conflict zones. Historically low grain stockpiles, high fertilizer prices, limited fertilizer availability, and food export restrictions imposed by about 20 countries also add to the list of causes. Moreover, 21 of the world’s 37 major aquifers are in decline. The Ganges and the Arabian aquifer systems, both sources of water for irrigation, are among those suffering serious depletion.\n\nThis is a multi-year crisis. Due to the many factors at play and the need for multiple growing seasons to restore supplies and markets, there are no quick or easy solutions. The fight against hunger must be conducted with a long-term perspective and on multiple fronts.\n\nThe U.S. government is engaged with a multi-year strategy that seeks to create food systems that are inclusive, resilient, and sustainable. We have expanded Feed the Future, the U.S. government’s flagship global hunger and food security initiative, to eight new countries, all in Africa. The United States is providing support to institutions such as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, which are contributing significantly to global food security. The Center’s drought-tolerant corn is now planted on 17 million acres in Africa.\n\n![](https://wp-img.daozhao.com/thefoodsecurity/article/d14fb34b-badb-4f41-85bb-0d403d72f2c8-GTY_1238828893.webp)\n<p class=\"_image_caption\">People wait in a line with groceries at the supermarket on Feb. 28, 2022 in Kyiv, Ukraine.<span class=\"extra\">Anastasia Vlasova, Getty Images</span></p>\n\nWe must ensure that all crops important to food security receive adequate research funding and are “climate ready” to increase production, provide more farmer income, better nutrition, and heightened resilience both to weather extremes and geopolitical shocks. This makes humanitarian and economic sense and is in everyone’s self-interest. Ask any farmer anywhere.\n\nThis investment in research also makes sense from a national security perspective, as conflict is both a cause and effect of food insecurity. Intensifying climate change and hunger increase the risk of conflict.\n\nStrengthening global food systems not only advances peace abroad but also helps our own farmers here at home. For wheat alone, every two cents invested by U.S. taxpayers generates one hundred dollars of benefit to our economy. And how does it impact the hungry? USAID programs, to cite but one example, have prevented 3.4 million children in target countries from being stunted.\n\nWhen we choose to invest in global food security, we all benefit. In joining world leaders at the United Nations to address food insecurity, we will leverage our investment and put America in the lead where it must be.\n\n![](https://wp-img.daozhao.com/thefoodsecurity/article/77a54f58-5e24-40bb-9b09-42f4693d3a20-Cary_Fowler2007_2236237.webp)\n<p class=\"_image_caption\">February 2008 - Cary Fowler, a 1967 White Station High School graduate, not far from the arctic seed vault near Svalbard, Norway.<span class=\"extra\">CommercialAppeal.com</span></p>\n\nCary Fowler is U.S. special envoy for global food security.\n","categories":["blogs"]}]
